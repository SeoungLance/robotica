# robotica
You play as a robot that can easily take things apart and repair them, a skilled repair-bot. Solve puzzles, collect source code to hack other robots and explore the inside of the machine in order to shut it down and find freedom. But is it at a cost? What morale choices are you making in the process? You decide.
